* clean up build response files: brf. It seems like comments are not
allowed so I'll put the comments here. On linux the build will fail since
it uses Windows commands for creating a library. If the build fails with
"lib not found" or something run
ar -r libminwin_gtk.a *.o
Get build from www.dsource.org and run with
build @gtk.brf or @win32.brf
